This repository contains a simple web page for looking up entrance exam scores.
Open `index.html` in a browser and enter a student's SBD or name to view their
results from `data.js`. Filters allow searching by school, class or result and
you can switch between table or card layout. Clicking on a student opens a
detail modal with an option to export the result as PDF. Charts provide
overviews of average scores by school and class as well as subject averages.
A dark mode toggle is also included.
